# Learning React

## Tutorials used:

- [Free Code Camp's Medium post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/yes-react-is-taking-over-front-end-development-the-question-is-why-40837af8ab76) on why React is so popular.
	- Explains this to you by walking through the core concepts.
	- Excellent, rigorous approach wherein we prove by example that React is a hell of a lot more useful re. information structure and time than vanilla JS in some cases.
		- Same example done in both.

- [React's official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to learn "real" syntax, use a local server, and create useful functionality.
	- By "real" syntax I mean the syntactic sugar on top of the React/ReactDOM methods we used in the FCC tutorial.

- React's docs are also useful and the folder with that title has code snippets etc. that I'm using to test out some of their examples
